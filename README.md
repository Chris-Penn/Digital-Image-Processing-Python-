You are given 3 text files, each with a list of numbers in them - which represent the voltage produced at each pixel location for a CMOS sensor while taking a particular picture. The _easy.txt and the _medium.txt files represent a 256 by 256 image, while the _hard.txt represents a 512 by 512 pixel image. So a list of (256 * 256) voltage values for the _easy.txt and _medium.txt files, and (512 * 512) values for the _hard.txt file.

Each of those “pictures” contain one of three objects - a ball, brick, or cylinder.

This program processes the images in each file.
